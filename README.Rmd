## Overview

The goal of clustMut is to call clustered mutations in sets of somatic mutations.
A clustered mutation is defined as the result of a local _hyper_-mutation event
which generates pairs of mutations that are closer than expected.

This **package** uses the output of a chromosomic distance randomization from
[randommut](http://fsupeksvr.irbbarcelona.pcb.ub.es/gitlab/dmas/randommut) and
a mutation stratification list to account for subclonal frequency.

## Installation

In order to install the package use:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("davidmasp/clustMut@develop")
```

You need to first install the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html) package.

You can download the bash launcher script from [this repo]() and move it
to a folder in your `$PATH`. If you update the R package, there's no need to
update this launcher.

### Dependencies

* Currently the package depends on genomicHelpersDMP which is beign transitioned to [helperMut](https://github.com/davidmasp/helperMut).
* The rest of R packages should be installed when instaling the package.
* Bash and UNIX is required to run the shell launcher script.

## Usage

A nextflow wrapper pipeline is available at
[hyperClust](https://github.com/davidmasp/hyperclust)
which will contain all the steps needed to perform the cluster calling steps.

You can use clustmut to obtain mutation clusters based on different methods.

### distance

```bash
clustmut distance -i /path/to/muts/ \
                --glob "*randomized.tsv" \
                --recursive \
                -o test_omichili \
                -Vlwtvu
```

### Boosting

In order to incorporate extra layers of information such as the clonal fraction
of the mutations or the strand pair a boosting list has to be provided.

The file should be a unique column list with the following information
`{rndmut_file_name}_stratification`.

```txt
chr:pos:sample:ref:alt_{group}
```

Where group is a set of mutations that will be grouped together in the analysis.

NOTE: Samples should allways be included in the group as default.
